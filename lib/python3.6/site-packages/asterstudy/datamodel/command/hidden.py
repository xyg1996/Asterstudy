Hidden Command
--------------

Implementation of the Hidden as a specfic Command sub class.

    """Special command to store a result of a macro-command.

    Macro-commands can create results that are not direct results of the
    operator (on the left of the equal sign).
    This syntax is not Python compliant but must be supported to work with
    the current versions of code_aster.

    *Hidden* allows to manage the creation of these additional results
    with a valid Python syntax.

    This looks like::

        # code_aster syntax
        res1 = MACRO_COMMAND(RESULT2=CO('res2'), <other keywords...>)
        ANOTHER(USE=res2)

        # asterstudy objects (symbolic)
        macro = Command(RESULT2=CO('res2'), ...)
        hidden = Hidden(DECL=<CO object>, PARENT=macro)

        # asterstudy objects (API)
        macro = stage('MACRO_COMMAND', 'res1')
        macro['RESULT2'] = 'res2'
        hidden = stage['res2']

    The *Hidden* is automatically created when a keyword with type 'CO'
    is assigned in the parent *Command*.
